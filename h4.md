## h4 Pkg-file-service

Unfortunately due to time constraints i was unable to complete the assignement in time. I managed to to install apache2 service and get it running and after that i wrote the configurations for apache2 installation and running in a .sls file as follows:  
[apache2:
  pkg.installed  
apache2:  
  service.running]  
  But i was unable to get the configuration file syntax right for changing the apache2 starting page, and i ran out of time to do it
