# Assignment 3 - Infrastructure as code

## A) Running infrastructure as code locally  
First step to take in this assignment is to start up virtual machines.  
I will be using vagrant to set up two machines now, because I will be needing them both in a future step.
I have vagrant already installed from previous assignments and I have a configuration file set up to start two machines (vagrant configuration can be found in this repository under file h2.md).  
So I only have to open the command line on my computer and give the command `vagrant up` and I will have two virtual machines ready to go.  
Next I will be downloading salt to both of the virtual machines. I will download salt-master to one machine and salt-minion on the other.  
(The entire documentation for that is also found in this repository under h2.md file)  
</br>
Now that I have two machines up and salt installed on both of them, I can start writing the file from which code will be run from.  
</br>
</br>
I will start by installing micro editor with the command `sudo apt-get install micro` and changing it to my default editor with the command `export EDITOR=micro`.  
(Hello Salt Infra-as-code, terokarvinen.com)
</br>
After this I will make a new directory under salt-directory with the command `sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/hello/` and then navigate into the new directory with the command `cd /srv/salt/hello/`.  
(Hello Salt Infra-as-code, terokarvinen.com)  
</br>

</br>  
After that, I will create a .sls file inside the newly created /hello folder with the command  
`sudoedit init.sls` (Hello Salt Infra-as-code, terokarvinen.com)  
<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f4f831-4f77-4803-8d24-ec344b8e591e" />  
Now that the new file is open in micro, I will start writing commands in to it so that I can run salt commands from the file.  
For now I will only write local commands. Running the commands to another machine comes in a future step.  
<img width="211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6535880-2eb5-4ed4-887f-43a457777a9d" />   
</br>
Now that the file has been created and commands written, IÂ´ll try to run the command  
`sudo salt-call --local state.apply hello` (Hello Salt Infra-as-code, terokarvinen.com)  
<img width="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3ad3a7-8231-417b-8ad2-0c931a1bbc39" />  
</br>
Oops, the command returned an error message. After a brief moment thinking about what went wrong, I noticed that I had made two typos when writing the command.  
I corrected the typos as seen in the screenshot below.  
<img width="202" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fdfaf4-d0bb-4f97-9738-37b7f7c73bb8" />
</br>  
Okay, that did not fix the error, back to the drawing board.  
After googling salt syntax and confirming that it was indeed correct, I started thinking that I may have forgotten to install updates to this machine.  
After installing updates and confirming that it did not fix the problem I started googling once again.  
And after about 30 minutes, I looked over this website (https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/overview.html#rules-of-yaml).  
And on the website it says that "Indentation sets the context. You MUST indent your properties and list with one or more spaces, but two spaces is standard."  
And like a fool, I was doing indentation with the tabulator and not with spaces. (Personal note: this was highly frustrating to figure out).  
</br>
</br>
Now that the problem was finally resolved, the command finally went through without errors.  
<img width="381" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e6c9a5-c174-4409-a89e-21631fa72694" />  
</br>  
To test the idempotency of the command, I ran it again and was greeted with this output.  
<img width="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296fbf16-6f3e-4264-a95b-2bdbf32b7370" />  
</br>
And as we can see, no additional changes are being made from consecutive runs.  
And for my final check I navigated to /tmp directory to see if the file was indeed made.  
<img width="228" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5f3938-28dd-4f57-987c-ae8d187c2069" />  
</br>

## B) Running the .sls file over net to slave
Now it is time to run the file to the slave from the master. By my mistake, I was accidentally running the previous steps on the slave-machine, so I will have to create the /hello file and .sls file to the master machine.  
Because I have already created a file in the slave machine, I slightly modified the file name that will be created.  
<img width="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699fd4cb-02e8-4ed3-8278-12a0a8b8d585" />  
</br>
Now I will use the command `sudo salt '*' state.apply hello` to make the file on the slave-machine.  
After fixing an another typo in the .sls file (mission ":" at the end of line one) I got an successful output  
<img width="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d7b813a-408e-4a0e-b942-e25717d335f8" />  
</br>
After that I navigated back to the slave-machine and checked that the file was indeed created.  
<img width="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd01101a-9aff-4685-9485-6cdc0133ab1e" />  
</br>
</br>
## C) Making a .sls file containing two state functions.  
</br>
First steps to making the .sls file is opening the file previously made and adding more functions to it. 
I will add the following functions:  
</br>
1. pkg.installed to download apache2.  
</br>
2. user.present to create a new user.  
</br>
</br>
I made the following changes to the .sls file:  
</br>
<img width="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8b559d-4381-4d79-9dfc-57c4ff463885" />  
</br>
After trying to run the commands, I was met with the following output.  
</br>
<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74399dc4-b040-4a64-a1bc-0686d2c1efb0" />  
</br>
After restarting salt on both machines and trying to run again, I was met with a positive output.  
</br>
<img width="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b231d8a-13b8-4150-b4e1-3cbf27f0c5cd" />  
</br>
I ran the command again to check that the commands given do not make additional changes on consecutive runs.  
</br>
<img width="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13bdc023-aa13-4b55-8712-5370e530e6ee" />  
</br>


And now finally I will check that the changes were made on the slave-machine.  
</br>
<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa62aba2-7619-44e8-94f7-6151b0d2d097" />  
</br>
<img width="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eac10c1-da0b-497e-a481-4d8997d20ec0" />  
</br>
